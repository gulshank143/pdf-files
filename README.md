# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


1. First i create react app by using vite { npm create vite@latest }.
2. then i install axios for fatching data 
3. If you want to run this project you can use [ npm run dev ].

in this project i use two component first one is PDFListView and Another one is PDFDetailView.
in PDFListView component when render then they showing the search bar where user search PDF name , Author name and get detail of the PDF and also showing all the list of PDF with PDF name, author and Published year. 

and in the another component user can see PDF detail and there is one hyperlink for open PDF.
